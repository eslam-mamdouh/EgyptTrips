We had a fantastic day. The hotel pick up was nice and easy and a pleasant air conditioned car trip to Luxor. No hassle of busy coaches with lots of other people super early in the morning. Perfect way to start the trip. Once arriving at our first destination we meet with our private guide Mahmood who was amazing. So knowledgeable, talking through the history of each place and providing opportunities to add to our trip if we wanted but happy to continue if we chose not to take any extras.  Going across the Nile by boat and going down to Tutankhamen&#39;s tomb was certainly worth the extra bit (about an extra £14). It was a long day but we got to take it at our pace and because it was a private tour there was no waiting around for others to rejoin the group and when its 42 degrees the last thing you want to be doing is waiting in the heat. We chose to do this experience on our 3 day (went for 10 day holiday) as we knew it was a long day and glad we did as we felt like we had need a few days to relax afterwards! I cannot speak highly enough of the places we saw and of Mahmood and the driver (apologies  I cant remember how to spell you name) but he stopped and pick us all up some ice lollies for the drive back which was very sweet.  If your looking to go to Luxor this was the way to do it!<br /><br />Thanks for a great day<br />Sarah & Steve</div><div class="logo">&nbsp;</div>

We received an email with all our details and where to meet to pay the outstanding balance of the trip. All went well and we arranged to be picked up at 5:15 am  we were met by an air conditioned car. The driver was really nice and friendly. It took about 3 and a half hours to arrive in Luxor. <br />We then met Mahmoud our guide and off to Karnak temple . After lunch we then went to the valley of the kings and Hatshepsut temple. Mahmoud was fantastic he kept us up to date with all the information we needed and explained the history of everywhere we went. His passion and enthusiasm shone through and we really enjoyed his company.<br />We did visit a Papurus shop and a Alabaster shop. To be honest we would have rather not done this but we understand why it’s on the tour. After that we said goodbye to Mahmoud and sent off back to Hurghada arriving around 8pm. It is a long day but well worth the trip. Thanks to Ibrahim the driver and Mahmoud for a fantastic day.</div><div class="logo">&nbsp;</div>

Luxor is a definite when on holiday in Egypt and highly recommend Egypt excursions... was very easy to organise everything with them... however we did find that the 2 days was not worth it as it could’ve easily been fitted into one day... on our first day we had checked into the hotel by 14:30 as we’d finished everything and then the extras we did to take up some time such as the Luxor tour was £60! And on the second day we had finished my 11:15am so just headed home. Was an amazing couple of days but very expensive to fill up time as itinary doesn’t fill up your day </div><div class="logo">&nbsp;</div>

Myself and my 2 sons have always been interested in history and so we thought this would be a good way of seeing some sights around Alexandria whilst taking in a bit of modern history. Overall the trip was organised very well, the booking team were great and reassured us that we would be collected and returned to our ship on time (a big worry!!).<br /><br />The day trip was really interesting and on returning we have actually read into the battle of El Alamein. Would encourage anyone stopping at Alexandria port to give this a go</div><div class="logo">&nbsp;</div>

Mamhood our guide was excellent very informative and funny great with the boys, also the camera.<br />Booking was easy online in uk before our holiday, much cheaper and personalised than through holiday reps. Paid with PayPal deposit in UK, email confirmation and meeting time arranged at Hotel to pay rest of the fee in cash..... I was little nervous handing over a wad of cash two days before the excursion but so glad I did. Fantastic day that my family will remember forever. </div><div class="logo">&nbsp;</div>
